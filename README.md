Intuitively, the "Original" folder contains the original code that I was given and had to refactor, and the "Refactored" folder contains my refactored version of the code. 
I decided to give every game object as well as every game mode its own class, minimising coupling and maximising cohesion so that I could use a "GameModes" factory to make maintaining and expanding the project much easier.
